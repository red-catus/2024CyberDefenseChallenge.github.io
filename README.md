# 2024 WiCyS Cyber Defense Challenge, made possible by Target


In July 2024, I participated in the 2024 Cyber Defense Challenge with Women in Cybersecurity (WiCyS). There are 3 tiers in this challenge as detailed in the photo below. This writeup covers the challenges in Tier 1. The challenge ended last week and I finished at the top 3%! Not bad for my 2nd CTF!

Tier 1 included offense and defense challenges. It was quite fun to complete challenges from both sides, but I admit I liked the defense challenges more. I am a career changer and have participated in 1 other CTF competition before this, so I set realistic goals for this competition.  I repeatedly told myself that learning is the main goal, so I was going to let my overthinking mind run free and have fun. However, the competitive side took over and pushed me to remain persistent (without brute forcing answers) and led to the completion of the Tier 1 challenges with over 2 weeks to spare! The Tier 1 challenge has concluded and I'm currently #25 out of 793 participants, so I'm happy and eagerly awaiting the official invitation to participate in the Tier 2 challenges. 

Each challenge is label with either D or O to represent defense and offense, respectively. I have also added the main tool or concept associated with each challenge. The format begins with the challenge scenario and background, objectives, and the solution. 



## The following is scenario of the Tier 1 challenge: 

Our tale begins in a quaint desert town with a looming water crisis and a history of organized crime, but this isn't about any of that.

No, we're concerned with the titanic cyber struggle waged between two legendary organizations:

### The Lucky Lion
This casino boasts its online gambling as a secure option for virtual thrill seekers. As a member of The Lucky Lion’s information security team, you’re charged with defending the casino against external and internal threats, but knowing the treasure trove you’re charged with guarding, this is easier said than done…

### Tacky Termite
Little is known about this shadowy organization, however the consensus amongst the cyber threat intelligence community is that:
Tacky Termite is an emerging, financially-motivated threat actor, likely operating out of Western Europe, and focused on monetizing activities such as selling accesses and partnering with other sophisticated eCrime actors.

Don't let that clinical overview fool you, those who hail from the cyber-lair known as "The Mound" are as devious as they come!

### Scenario
Tacky Termite, known to target high profile organizations, has finally set its sites on The Lucky Lion. Neither side has ever known defeat in the cyber realm! Will Tacky Termite hollow out this once mighty casino, or does the house indeed always win?
Solve challenges for both of these organizations to find out what happens and earn points along the way!
